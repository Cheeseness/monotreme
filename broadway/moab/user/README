This directory is intended for MOAB's ever evolving user abstraction.

NOTE:  Please remember that while MOAB is intended to provide Platform
       Independence via Agnostic Abstractions, it is OK to be UNIX/Linux
       centric in our implementations and even in our current abstractions.

       There are several reasons this is not only OK (even laudible):

       * Frequently, what's viewed is the "perfect abstraction" is only
         perfect today.
       * If this is the first time a problem is being solved in the context of
         MOAB and Broadway, there is not enough information to make perfect
         design decisions.
       * Over-implementing a vague abstraction usually leads to interfaces
         that include falls-constraints.
       * Ultimately, software is just the implementation of an abstraction,
         not a monument cast in stone.
       * If you could presict the future, you would not have to be a
         software engineer to make money...

       For all these reasons and more, software is never done.  Therefore,
       write software that can be changed.

P.S.  None of the above is an excuse to write bad code.

CONTENTS:
        identity.py:    Implements Broadway's underlying identity concepts.
                        In otherwords the API related to uniquely identify
                        an individual user of the system.

                        This is part of MOAB for two major reasons:
                        1)  It is required by other parts of MOAB (e.g.
                            the configuration service.)
                        2)  To support the most powerful identity abstraction,
                            it should ultimately relay on the underlying OS
                            to simplify coordinating efforts with other parts
                            of the system.

        management.py:  Provides Broadway's underlying API to manage users and
                        there roles.
