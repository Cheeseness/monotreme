This is the catch all location for MOAB modules that are completely unrefined.
In other words, it's a staging area.  The code in here should be stable and
usable, but it doesn't have to be named "well", organized "correctly", nor
does it need to be the "perfect abstraction."

It is perfectly OK for releases to rely on STAGEd implementations, as a matter
of fact that is the whole point.  If something belongs in MOAB but your not
sure where, or the abstraction isn't obvious, put it in here.  Modules (source
files) and packages (source directories) and anything else required to build
MOAB support can be placed here.

As we gain experience with the code, functionality, and requirements that led
to staged code we will replace the staged implementation with one that is named
"well", organized "correctly", and represents "perfect abstraction."()

(1) There is no such thing as a "perfect abstraction."  By the nature of
being an abstraction (aka a model), it is a gross oversimplification of
reality. Therefore, an abstraction has a great deal less detail then whatever
is being abstracted.  Just another reason not to get too hung-up on certain
details...
