This is the root "package" created for two purposes:
  1. Move towards renaming everything RZ/Richards-Zeta instead of Envenergy.
  2. To merge in the Omega project into the Broadway source tree.

Things that may be confusing:
  1. The envenergy.nodedefs.all package.  It has not been renamed because
     I think the configuration tool hard codes in that package name for
     all nodedefs.  But I could be wrong...
  2. The envenergy.nodedefs.all package.  Is not currently built as it is
     still grabbed from opt/envenergy...
