To add SNMP support to a Mediator:
==================================

From the configTool, select /services/network and add SNMP. 

To add a Remote Agent and get access to it's values:
====================================================

From the configTool, select /services/network/SNMP/Remote Agents and add
an "SNMP Remote Agent."

* Set the name of the remote agent, this has no effect operationally but for
  organizational purposes the agent should be given a meaningful name.
* Configure the IP address of the Remote Agent.
* Add the MIBs used by the Remote Agent.  These must be PySNMP build in MIBs
  or pre-compiled mpx/lib/snmp/mibs/ MIBs.

Add the appropriate "protocol" configuration child Node to the Remote Agent:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select one of SNMPv1, SNMPv2c or SNMPv3 and set the appropriate configuration
data.

NOTES:  This node must be named to match it's type, which should happen by
        default.

	More than one protocol Node can be present, but only one can be
        enabled at a time.

To Log Traps:
=============

1. Ensure that /services/network/SNMP/Default Traps is enabled and configured.
2. Add an "SNMP Trap Log" to /services/logger.
   NOTE:  This MUST be named "SNMP Trap Log"

To export SNMP Traps as email messages:
---------------------------------------

1. To /services/logger/SNMP Trap Log/exporters add an "SNMP Event Based Trap
   Exporter" (trap_exporter)
2. In /services/logger/SNMP Trap Log/exporters/trap_exporter (or whatever you
   named it) configure:

      smtp_formatter
   and
      smtp_transporter

===============================================================================

OTHER NOTES:

1. smtp_formatter and smtp_transporter probably should not be inherent children
   of the trap_exporter.
