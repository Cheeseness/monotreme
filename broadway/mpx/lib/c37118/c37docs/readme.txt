The files in this directory are complimentary to the c37.118 source code.
Most of the files should be documentation-related.

List of files in this directory and their descriptions:

implementation_notes.txt - General theory on how the C37.118 protocol processes
                           and threads are implemented.  Also contains notes on
                           reasoning behind offloading the continuous data part
                           of the protocol to a C process.  Code profiling data
                           is stored in this file as well.
mediator-c-process-use-case.xmi - A graphical example of how a typical C37.118
                           connection works (drawn in Umbrello)
ipcu_continuous_fs.txt   - Functional Spec
