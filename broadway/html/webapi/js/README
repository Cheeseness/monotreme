Important changes in support of IE 7 (and sanity):

1. The _name is MUST be set on each derived Widget's prototype.
   Example:  EmbeddedGraph.prototype._name = 'EmbeddedGraph'
2. The _factory function has been removed.  It was icky (and causing
   confusion).
3. So, references to the factory, are now references to the constructor.
4. The constructor takes an editDoc argument so cerateElement will work
   consistently in IE 7 (and presumably all browsers).
5. In general, widget implementations should use this.edit_doc instead of
   the global document.  Unfortunately there are exceptions, the
   get_*_defaults and the after_config functions should use the current
   global document which is the WebExpress Configuration window.

NOTE:
  Methinks it would be clearer to use a getter functions, although actually
  a config_doc variable might be good enough...
