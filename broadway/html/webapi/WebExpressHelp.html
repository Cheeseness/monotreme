	<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="webefore"></a>Before Using WebExpress</strong><br>
  Before using WebExpress, you can create a template web page to hold WebExpress
      widgets. This page can include static HTML content such as a company logo
      image. You can create template files using your favorite HTML editor,
  such as Macromedia's Dreamweaver(tm).  After creation, a template web page
      must be transferred to the Mediator using a file-transfer protocol such
      as FTP. Using a template web page will insure a consistent look and feel
      for your WebExpress applications.</font></p>
	<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="westart"></a>Starting WebExpress</strong><br>
  When you start WebExpress, you are presented with a web page that gives you
      a choice of editing an existing file, or creating a new file. Existing
      files can be template files, or a previously edited WebExpress page. You
      may select an existing
  file for editing by selecting a file in the selection box, then clicking the
      &quot;Edit&quot; button. Please be careful not to edit files that you are unfamiliar
      with, as some
      of the
      HTML files
      listed are used by the Mediator software, and can be damaged by editing.
      If you choose to edit a new file,
  the WebExpress editor will create a new HTML page for you. You can edit a new
      file by clicking the &quot;New File&quot; button.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="createwidget"></a>Creating a Widget</strong><br>
  To create a new widget, you must first select the widget type in the selection
      box in the upper left portion of the editor window. When you have selected
      a widget type, then click on the &quot;Create&quot; button located to the right of
      the selection box. After confirmation of the operation, a new widget will
      be created in the top left corner of the edit document.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="copywidget"></a>Copying a Widget</strong><br>
  To copy a widget, you must first select an existing widget to be copied in
      the edit document. You can select the widget by clicking on it. The widget
      is selected if its outline is red. When the existing widget is selected,
      click on the &quot;Copy&quot; button located in the upper right portion of the editor.
      After confirmation of the operation, a copy of the existing widget will
      be created in the top left corner of the edit document.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="deletewidget"></a>Deleting a Widget</strong><br>
  To delete a widget, you must first select the widget to be deleted in the edit
      document. You can select the widget by clicking on it. The widget is selected
      if its outline is red. When the existing widget is selected, click on the
      &quot;Delete&quot; button located in the upper right portion of the editor. After
      confirmation of the operation, the selected widget will disappear from
      edit window.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="configurewidget"></a>Configuring Widget Properties</strong><br>
  Widgets have many properties that control their appearance and function. Each
      existing widget within the edit document can be individually configured.
      To configure a widget, you must first select the widget for configuration
      in the edit
      document.
      You
      can select the widget by clicking on it. The widget is selected if its
      outline is red. When the existing is selected, click on the first &quot;Configure&quot;
      button located on the left side of the editor. A widget configuration dialog
      window will open. After editing the parameters in the configuration dialog
      window, you can click &quot;Save&quot; to close the dialog and make the changes to
      the widget take effect. Or, you can click &quot;Cancel&quot; to abort the changes,
      close the dialog, and return to the main editor window.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="configurepage"></a>Configuring Page Properties</strong><br>
  Each web page containing WebExpress widgets has a number of global properties
      that affect the operation of all widgets on the page. These properties
      can be edited by clicking on the second &quot;Configure&quot; button located on the
      left side of the editor. When you click this button, a page properties
      dialog window will be opened. After editing the parameters in the page
      properties dialog window, you can click the &quot;Save&quot; button to close the
      dialog and make the changes take effect. Or, you can click the &quot;Cancel&quot;
      button to abort the changes, close the dialog, and return to the main editor
      window.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="positionwidget"></a>Positioning Widgets</strong><br>
  Existing widgets in the edit document can be positioned in three dimensions.
      Each widget has an X-coordinate, a Y-coordinate, and a Z-index. The X-coordinate
      and Y-coordinate indicate the position of the top left corner of the widget
      relative to the top left corner of the edit document. The Z-index controls
      the &quot;layer&quot; position of the widget relative to other widgets. Widgets are
      initially created with a Z-index of 1000, which will make them appear
      over existing page content. To change the X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, or
      Z-index of a widget, you must first select the widget in the edit document.
      You can select the desired widget by clicking on it. A widget that is selected
      will have a red outline. To change the X-coordinate, Y-coordinate, or Z-index
      of a selected widget, you enter a new value in the appropriate input box
      located on the the left side of the editor. A carriage return is required
      to effect the change.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="savefile"></a>Saving Files</strong><br>
  To save the edited web page, click on the &quot;Save File&quot; button located in the
      upper right portion of the editor window. When you click the Save File
      button, a Save File dialog window will open. In this window, you can select
      the file name under which you will save your work. By choosing
      a different file name from the file name which you originally opened, you
      can perform
      a &quot;Save As&quot; operation (i.e., the file will be saved under a different name,
      and the original file is left untouched). If you use the existing file
      name, the file will be overwritten.</font></p>
