    <h1>Alarm Manager</h1>
    <div class="help" id="alarmmanager">
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a name="name" id="name">Name</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is the name of the alarm as configured when the alarm
          was created.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <a name="state" id="state">State</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is the current state of the the named alarm.
          The alarm state will be one of the following:
          <dl>
            <dt>RAISED</dt>
            <dd>
              This is the beginning state of all alarms.  An alarm in the
              raised state has been triggered by a configured alarm
              condition, and the trigger condition is still "in-alarm",
              meaning that the trigger has not left the alarm condition
              since this alarm was triggered.
            </dd>
            <dt>ACCEPTED</dt>
            <dd>
              The state a RAISED alarm enters when the alarm has been manually
              acknowledged.  The term "ACCEPTED" is used to indicate that the
              person or agent acknowledging the alarm has accepted
              responsibility for transitioning the alarm out of the RAISED
              state.
            </dd>
            <dt>CLEARED</dt>
            <dd>
              The state a RAISED alarm enters if, before being acknowledged
              manually acknowledged, the trigger condition which caused the
              alarm has left the "in-alarm" state.  The existence of a
              particular alarm in the CLEARED state does not necessarilly
              mean that the alarm condition is not <em>currently</em>
              "in-alarm", it means only that the trigger condition has left
              the "in-alarm" state at some point since this alarm was
              triggered.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              It is the lack of an alarm in the RAISED and ACCEPTED states
              that can be used to determine whether an alarm condition
              <em>currently</em> exists for a particular trigger.
            </dd>
            <dt>CLOSED</dt>
            <dd>
              This is the end of an alarm event's life-cycle.  There are
              two ways an alarm may enter the CLOSED state: an alarm in
              the ACCEPTED state has been cleared, or an alarm in the
              CLEARED state has been acknowledged.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Typically alarms in the CLOSED state will not be visible
              on the alarm management interface.  This is not because
              there are no alarms that have completed their life-cycle;
              it is only because CLOSED alarms have not remaining actions
              and are considered irrelevent with the exception of
              historical analysis and reporting.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <a name="time" id="time">Time</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The is the time at which an alarm event began.  Comparing this
          time to the current time will indicate how long a particular
          alarm event has been in existence; it is created the moment
          the alarm event entered the RAISED state.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <a name="description" id="description">Description</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is the description provided for an alarm when the alarm
          was configured.  Configured properly, this information should
          provide a thorough explanation of the meaning of a particular
          alarm.  While the alarm name will typically provide some
          indication as to the type of an alarm, such as "High Temp,"
          this information should provide details specific to a particular
          alarm.  Such details should include the location of the alarm,
          the full meaning of the alarm, the device or devices associated
          with the alarm.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <a name="apply" id="apply">Apply</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Each entry in this column provides a dropdown list of "actions"
          that may be applied to a particular alarm.  Selections are applied
          to, and only to, the alarm instance in the same row as the
          dropdown.  When a particular action is selected, the action is
          immediately applied to the alarm.  In other words, action and
          execution are combined in a single-step; choosing a particular
          action from the list will select that action <em>and</em>
          apply that action.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The following actions are available:
          <dl>
            <dt>
              Acknowledge
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Selecting this action "acknowledges" an alarm.  The
              acknowledgement of an alarm may have two distinct
              effects, depending upon the current state of the alarm
              being acknowledged.*
            </dd>
            <dd>
              If the alarm being acknowledged is currently in the RAISED
              state, then the acknowledgement of the alarm will transition
              the alarm to the ACCEPTED state.  Because an ACCEPTED alarm
              was in the RAISED state when the acknowledgement took place,
              and because the alarm may <em>still</em> be in the RAISED
              state were it not for the acknowledgement, the acknowledging
              party has <em>accepted</em> responsibility for the monitoring
              and management of the alarm and the alarm condition.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              If, on the other hand, the alarm being acknowledged is
              currently in the CLEARED state, then the acknowledgement of
              the alarm will transition the alarm to the CLOSED state.
              Once an alarm has been closed, it is considered complete
              and no longer subject to real-time monitoring and management.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              * The reason two sequences of alarm acknowledgement
              have been provided is to insure that alarms do not go
              unoticed.  In particular, this mechanism insures that
              all alarms, even transient alarms which are often cleared
              immediately following being triggered, are not overlooked
              by the alarm management team.
            </dd>
            <dt>Snooze</dt>
            <dd>
              The Snooze action will silence a particular alarm instance for
              a predetermined amount of time.  The snooze option will only
              be available for alarms of low or medium criticality, and only
              for those alarms of priority lower than 1.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              The Snooze command is always associated with a particular time
              interval.  The intervals available are: 5 min, 10 min, 15 min,
              30 min, 45 min, and 60 min.  Each setting will cause the alarm
              to snooze for the indicated time interval.  After a snooze time
              interval has elapsed, the alarm will return to whatever state
              is appropriate.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              The Snooze operation only affects alarm monitoring and
              presentation.  Alarms will still be subject to, and
              aware of, all state transitions and actions associated
              with general alarms.  It is therefore possible that,
              during an alarm snooze, the alarm's state changes as a
              result of incoming events.  Because the alarm life-cycle
              is one in which each step is of equal or lesser criticality
              than the previous steps, state transitions need not disrupt
              the snooze action.
            </dd>
            <dt>View Detail</dt>
            <dd>
              Selecting this action will transport the user, or present to
              the user, a more detailed view of a particular alarm.  The
              availability and contents of this detailed view will be
              determined partly by the alarm's configuration.
            </dd>
            <dt>Configure</dt>
            <dd>
              Move to a configuration screen for this alarm.  The
              configuration screen will not provide access to the
              alarm management operations, it will instead provide
              access to reconfiguration methods for the alarm.  From
              the configuration screen one can adjust thresholds for
              the alarm, modify the description for the alarm, change
              the priority and criticality for the alarm, and even to
              delete or redefine the alarm entirely.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Only users with system adminstration and configuration
              privelages will be able to apply this action or access
              the configuration interface.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              The reason this shortcut has been provided is to allow
              adjustment and tuning of the running system from the
              alarm management panel.  In particular, this is designed
              to simplify the tuning required to eliminate nuissance alarms.
              Nuissance alarms, or alarms that are unecessary or triggered
              merely as a symptom of another problem which is itself being
              monitored and managed, are considered one of the greatest
              challenges to effective alarm management.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <a name="group" id="group">Group</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Selecting this checkbox marks the row, and associated alarm, for
          group management actions.  At the bottom of the alarm management
          page users will find a panel providing operations similar to those
          provided by the dropdown in each individual alarm.  The meaning of
          the available actions are, in fact, exactly as they are in each
          alarm row.  By choosing an action from this set of controls, the
          user is choosing an action that will be applied to <em>all</em>
          rows whose Group checkbox has been checked.  This is a convenience
          mechanism and does not provide any functionality beyond what is
          provided by each alarm row individually; in fact, certain operations
          available from the individual rows are not available as group
          actions.
