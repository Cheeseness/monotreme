Run ./INSTALL_STUBS to create a developer's installation of all
the standards broadway/tools.  The only file actually directly
copied to ~/bin is the dev_stub script.  All other commands are links
to ~/bin/dev_stub.  dev_stub uses the link name that invoked it, and
the current directory to determine which command to actually execute.
